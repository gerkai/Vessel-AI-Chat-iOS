        TitleDescription(title: Constants.HOW_TO_READ_THE_GRAPH, description: NSLocalizedString("Here are the reference ranges we use for calcium:\nLow: 0 - 30 mg mg/L\nGood: 30 - 110 mg/L\nHigh: >110 mg/L\n\nWhen we eat calcium, only about 25% - 50% is absorbed in our small intestines. Food and gastric acid seem to improve absorption. Also calcium absorption appears to be dependent on having enough vitamin D. Once it enters our bloodstream, only 8% - 10% circulates in the metabolically active ionized form, while 40% - 45% circulates bound to proteins, and 40% - 45% circulates as free dissociated ions. Serum levels are maintained at or near 10 mg/dL by the actions of parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, and vitamin D. 99% of our total body calcium is in our skeletal system while the other 1% is in an exchangeable pool in our other tissues and circulation.  Calcium regulation is influenced by the actions of glucocorticoids, thyroid hormone, growth hormone, insulin, and estrogen. Calcium losses vary with dietary intake and approximate 300 - 600mg each day.  Renal filtration in adults is approx 8.6 g/day of which all but 100 - 200mg is reabsorbed back into the circulation. Daily fecal losses include approximately 150 mg of calcium coming from intestinal secretions as well as unabsorbed dietary calcium. Small losses in sweat (15 mg/day) may occur as well.\n\nWhen you’re in the good zone (darker purple), your body is likely getting sufficient calcium to support your wellness.\n\nWhen you ingest more calcium than your body needs, more calcium is excreted in your urine and this likely means you may be getting more calcium than you need but it could be also a sign of a medical problem or medication side effect.\n\nLow urine calcium levels suggest that you aren’t getting enough calcium to support your general wellness, and you may benefit from increasing your intake of both calcium and possibly vitamin D.  Check out the recommendations in the app for how to do that.\n\nReferences:\n-    [https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/41/11/683/2504912](https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/41/11/683/2504912)\n-   [https://www.labcorp.com/tests/003269/calcium-urine](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/003269/calcium-urine)\n-[https://www.labcorp.com/tests/134908/calcium-creatinine-ratio](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/134908/calcium-creatinine-ratio)\n-[https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Correlation-Between-24-Hour-Urine-Calcium-and-the-Spot-Urine-Calcium-to-Creatinine-Ratio_fig1_26817705](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Correlation-Between-24-Hour-Urine-Calcium-and-the-Spot-Urine-Calcium-to-Creatinine-Ratio_fig1_26817705)\n-[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3295234/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3295234/)\n\nPediatric range References:\n-[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1648734/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1648734/)\n-[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449613/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6449613/)\n-[https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/41/11/683/2504912](https://academic.oup.com/labmed/article/41/11/683/2504912)\n-  Nutrition in Clinical Practice: A Comprehensive, Evidence-Based Manual for the Practitioner (Nutrition in Clinical Practice), 2nd Edition by David Katz.", comment: "")),
        TitleDescription(title: Constants.WHY_IT_MATTERS, description: NSLocalizedString("Calcium is the most abundant mineral in our bodies. About 99% is stored in our bones and teeth, and the other 1% is in our blood and soft tissue. Calcium levels in the blood must be tightly regulated to maintain normal functioning in our bodies. Calcium plays a key role in bone health and strength, hormone secretion, constriction and relaxation of blood vessels, nerve impulse transmission, muscular contraction, and enzyme function.\n\nCalcium absorption is dependent on adequate levels of Vitamin D. Absorption is also enhanced when calcium is ingested with food.  If we aren’t getting enough calcium in our diet, the body will reduce urinary excretion of calcium and start to dissolve our bones and teeth to release calcium stores.  If we’re getting enough or too much calcium in our diets, our body will increase urinary excretion of calcium, and reduce bone resorption. Also, dietary salt, protein, and caffeine all lead to increased calcium loss in the urine.\n\nThe majority of people (especially women) are not getting enough calcium in their diets. Optimizing calcium levels can help to prevent osteoporosis, lower blood pressure, and may confer some protection against colon cancer.\n\nReferences:\n-    Weaver CM. Calcium.

        TitleDescription(title: Constants.TIPS_TO_IMPROVE, description: NSLocalizedString("The best way to improve your calcium levels is with fresh whole foods because calcium in nature is accompanied by other important nutrients that assist the body in utilizing calcium. Some people who have challenges getting enough calcium from food may benefit from additional calcium in the form of supplementation. If taking supplemental calcium, try to find active forms such as calcium citrate or calcium malate to improve absorption. Also, don’t take more than 500mg of elemental calcium at one time to maximize intestinal absorption.\n\nAlso, dietary protein leads to increased calcium loss in the urine. Every 50g increment of protein ingested leads to an additional 60 mg of calcium lost in the urine.  Sodium and caffeine also increase urinary loss of calcium.\n\nClick on the “grow” link at the bottom of the app to see your personalized food and supplement recommendations.\n\nHere’s how we make your food and supplement suggestions. Every 5 years the US government has a team of scientific experts review the literature on nutrition and health to determine the recommended daily intake (RDI) of many different micronutrients and publish this information for free to the public. We start here as the foundation for our recommendations. We then build upon this to customize recommendations for each user based on their Vessel test results. To determine this formula we take into account the expert opinion of our medical and scientific board of doctors, scientists, and registered dietitians looking at the medical evidence for the risks and benefits of being high vs low in a certain nutrient. For example, if a nutrient could be dangerous at high levels (such as potassium), we would never suggest higher than the US recommended daily intake (RDI).\n\nReferences:\n-[https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf](https://health.gov/sites/default/files/2019-09/2015-2020_Dietary_Guidelines.pdf)\n-   Nutrition in Clinical Practice: A Comprehensive, Evidence-Based Manual for the Practitioner (Nutrition in Clinical Practice), 2nd Edition by David Katz.", comment: ""))])
